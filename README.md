## Data Preparation Summary

The dataset was restructured and cleaned using the following steps:

- **Unpivoted Data**: Transformed wide-format metrics into long format for better Tableau handling.
- **Attribute Splitting**: Separated product-specific metrics (e.g., `sports_ngr_eur`) into two fields: `attribute` and `product`.
- **Type Adjustments**: Year and month converted to string types for flexible date handling.
- **Aggregation Handling**: Where inconsistencies were found (e.g., bonus totals), pre-aggregated fields were used to maintain data integrity.
- **Metric Calculations**: 
  - FTD Conversion = `FTDs / Registrations`
  - Revenue Per User = `Revenue / Total Users`
  - Withdrawal Rate = `Withdrawn / Total Amount`
  - Click Conversion = `Clicks / Views`
